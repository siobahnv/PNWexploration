    - Naked Bike Ride is still probably a thing...
- Upcoming events
    - How to source?
    - Calendar?
    - Agenda list may be better: Day, Weekend, Month?
- Section dedicated to the outdoors?
    - Hiking
    - Camping
    - Rafting, etc.
- Trip planning: ex. hosting some guests and want to give them a tour while they visit

Build the Bucket List similar to a TODO app? Tracking. <br>

Probably tags? some way to filter? <br>
PDX vs PNW <br>
Transit-friendly vs Vehicle <br>
Location: Portland, Coast, Ashland, etc. <br>
Categories: Events, Activities <br>
Other: Food, Drinking, Art & Museums, Commedy, Fairs & Festivals, Free, Outdoors, Day Trips, Points of Interest, Gardens, Food Carts, Water Activies, Parks, Waterfalls <br>

Is there a way to make it easier to do these things with friends & family? <br>
FourSquare is dead, but there's a thing called Swarm that lives and other options. <br>

Voting? vote on favorite bucket lists etc. <br>

FunCheapSF has a form to submit events, might be okay feature. Also has a DMCA Requests page which will probably eventually be necessary, though this is just a hobby site. <br>

Personal fav/preference easter-egg-like: Halloween/Witchy Corner? <br>
- Sky events: meteor showers
- Moon phases
- Ghost tours
- Specific bucket lists items: Witch hut in Forest Park
Can even CSS style it fun and different from the rest with cute animations. <br>

Easter-egg-like: is there anything nerdy like Kokoro Seeds to go hunting for? There is the McMenamin's passport already. <br>
