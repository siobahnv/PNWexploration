    - Portland Specific
        - Powell's Books
        - Japanese Garden
        - Zoo

        - etc.

    - Lights festival in February
    - Seasonal festivals, Halloween etc.
    - Naked Bike Ride is still probably a thing...
- Upcoming events
    - How to source?
    - Calendar?
    - Agenda list may be better: Day, Weekend, Month?
- Section dedicated to the outdoors?
    - Hiking
    - Camping
    - Rafting, etc.
- Trip planning: ex. hosting some guests and want to give them a tour while they visit

Build the Bucket List similar to a TODO app? Tracking.

Probably tags? some way to filter? 
PDX vs PNW
Transit-friendly vs Vehicle
Location: Portland, Coast, Ashland, etc.
Categories: Events, Activities
Other: Food, Drinking, Art & Museums, Commedy, Fairs & Festivals, Free, Outdoors, Day Trips, Points of Interest, Gardens, Food Carts, Water Activies, Parks, Waterfalls

Is there a way to make it easier to do these things with friends & family?
FourSquare is dead, but there's a thing called Swarm that lives and other options.

Voting? vote on favorite bucket lists etc.

FunCheapSF has a form to submit events, might be okay feature. Also has a DMCA Requests page which will probably eventually be necessary, though this is just a hobby site.

Personal fav/preference easter-egg-like: Halloween/Witchy Corner?
- Sky events: meteor showers
- Moon phases
- Ghost tours
- Specific bucket lists items: Witch hut in Forest Park
Can even CSS style it fun and different from the rest with cute animations.

Easter-egg-like: is there anything nerdy like Kokoro Seeds to go hunting for? There is the McMenamin's passport already.
